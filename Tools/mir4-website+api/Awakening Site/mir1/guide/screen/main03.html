						<li>The decision of a job is made by setting the attribute value, and if you accumulate experience points and a certain attribute 
							level becomes 11 or higher, you will be recognized as that job.
						<li>First, when you first start, you will be randomly assigned to one of the above jobs and the attribute value will be set.<br>
							If you want to change this, you can lower the value that has already been set and raise the desired attribute.
						<li>The decision of attribute experience points increases by the set value every time you accumulate 500 experience points.
						<li>Since each attribute has a tendency that conflicts with other attributes, you should only raise one attribute at a time.
						<li>Good/evil are unrelated to other job attributes, so you can raise either good or evil. 
						<li>If you kill a lot in the castle, your notoriety will increase and your character name will turn red. 
							When your notoriety reaches 20%, your name color will change. When it exceeds 50%, there are restrictions in the game (you can't buy things). 
							Your notoriety will slowly decrease over time.
