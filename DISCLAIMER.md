# Disclaimer

**THIS REPOSITORY IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH WEMADE ENTERTAINMENT**

- The contents of this repository consist of three distinct parts:  
  1. **Server-side source code**, which was **received anonymously** in 2019 from an unnamed third party.  
     - Upon receipt the code was incomplete and did not build—missing files and pieces were patched and restored by our team.  
  2. **Tools and other software** that have been **developed entirely from scratch** by the contributors.  
  3. **No client-side source code** is included here.

## Substantial Modifications & Original Content

- Significant effort has gone into making the leaked server-side code compile and function correctly. All fixes, additions, and build scripts present here are our own work—**not** provided by Wemade Entertainment.  
- The tools and utilities included are original creations and are offered under the licensing terms in [LICENSE.md].

## No Endorsement

I am not, and have never been, employed by or contracted with Wemade Entertainment or any of its affiliates. This project is **entirely unofficial**—assembled from leaked materials and our own engineering efforts for **educational, archival, and research purposes only**.

## No Warranty / “Use at Your Own Risk”

This code (both leaked server code and original tools) is provided **as-is**, without warranty of any kind, express or implied. In no event shall the authors be liable for any damages arising from the use or inability to use this code.
